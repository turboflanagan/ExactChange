//Find change amount. change = Cash - price
// convert change to decimal. parseFloat()








//Return the string "Insufficient Funds" if 
//cash-in-drawer is less than the change due.
// Sum up cash-in-drawer to compare with changeDue/

//Return the string "Closed" if cash-in-drawer 
//is equal to the change due.

//Otherwise, return change in coin and bills, 
//sorted in highest to lowest order.


//Compare change to currencyValue to determine highest possible denom to make
//change.  Subtract that currencyValue amount from change until change is less
//than currencyValue amount.   Proceed to next lower currencyValue index.
