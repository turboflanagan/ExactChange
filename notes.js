//Find change amount. change = Cash - price
// convert change to decimal. parseFloat()

//Compare change to currencyValue to determine highest possible denom to make
//change.  Subtract that currencyValue amount from change until change is less
//than currencyValue amount.   Proceed to next lower currencyValue index.
